## Made for the shot

OpenPocketCine is a production monitor and remote for **DJI Osmo Nano**.
This branch supports Nano only, using its AVC live view. Bluetooth discovery,
saved-camera lists and connection entry points exclude other camera models.
See the [Nano profile](handbook/src/content/docs/guides/nano.md) for the retained
controls and verification requirements.

iOS (iPhone and iPad) is the daily driver. Android is available as a
[public beta on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opencapture.openpocketcine&hl=en-US&ah=mXzHtdYCMQTB83vt0jIRLnOOZaA).

- **Read the image like a colorist.** Waveform, RGB parade, histogram, and vectorscope run live on
  the iOS monitor.
- **Catch exposure and focus before the take.** False color, zebras, Traffic Lights, and focus
  peaking paint the iOS feed.
- **Frame once for every delivery.** Grids, aspect guides, and a center crosshair stay on the
  picture.
- **Run the camera from the phone.** Record, take photos, adjust ISO, shutter,
  white balance and exposure compensation using Nano's reported capabilities.
- **Review before striking the set.** On iOS, browse clips and stills, scrub playback, check
  scopes, and preview the look.
- **Ship it with the look baked in.** On iOS, built-in or custom `.cube` LUTs, native share, and
  optional Frame.io upload when you add your own Adobe app keys.

Verify record start/stop on the camera body until you trust the link. Reverse-engineered control
can be incomplete.

## See it in action

**Scopes.** Read the image like a colorist. Waveform, RGB parade, histogram, and
vectorscope run live beside the image you are judging, with Traffic Lights on the feed.

  </a>
</p>

**View assist.** Catch it before the take. False color, zebras, Traffic Lights, peaking,
grids, and crosshairs sit on the iOS assist rail — including in portrait.

  </a>
</p>

**Camera control.** Record, photos, ISO, shutter, white balance and exposure
compensation stay available. Nano has no gimbal, autofocus or camera zoom.

    <img alt="Camera controls and zoom while recording" src="site/assets/screens/camera-controls.webp" width="820">
  </a>
</p>

**Media library.** On iOS, browse clips and stills on the camera. Star the keepers and
delete bad takes before you pack up.

    <img alt="Media library showing clips and photos on iPhone" src="site/assets/screens/media-library.webp" width="820">
  </a>
</p>

**Playback.** On iOS and Android, the same scopes and assists as live view, armed from
the playback rail (GPU LUT / peaking / zebra on Android playback is a follow-up; the
chips already persist). Export with an optional baked LUT on iOS, preview high-frame-rate
clips at conform speed, share natively, or upload to [Frame.io](https://www.frame.io/)
when Frame.io is configured.

## Available today

- Bluetooth pairing, camera Wi-Fi join, saved-camera profiles, and reconnect
- Live-view monitoring, timecode, battery, storage, and camera status readouts
- Nano recording, photo capture, ISO, shutter, white balance and EV controls
- Scopes, exposure and focus assists, framing tools, and customizable DISP chrome on iOS
- Clip browsing, playback, LUT preview, LUT bake and Convert log on export, and optional Frame.io on iOS
- Universal iPhone and iPad app (one adaptive monitor; pairing uses a wider two-column layout)

The native Android implementation lives in this repository as a phone shell with live pairing,
AVC live view, and GPU LUT / peaking / false colour / zebra on the feed. Join the
[public beta on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opencapture.openpocketcine&hl=en-US&ah=mXzHtdYCMQTB83vt0jIRLnOOZaA). Clip export LUT bake, Convert log, and
GPU scopes are iOS today.

Supported camera: **Osmo Nano**. Physical regression of this Nano-only branch
is required on both platforms before release.

## Roadmap shaped in the open

The roadmap lives in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/erik-sutton95/OpenPocketCine/discussions),
where proposed features can have their own thread. Browse the
[Ideas category](https://github.com/erik-sutton95/OpenPocketCine/discussions/categories/ideas)
to vote, add production context, or propose what OpenPocketCine should tackle next. Roadmap
discussions describe direction, not promised dates or release commitments. Engineering-phase detail
lives in [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md).

## Free. Open source. Yours

No subscriptions, no paywalls, no advertising, and no telemetry. OpenPocketCine is Apache-2.0
licensed and built in public with the latest frontier models — Grok, Codex, and Claude — so
filmmakers and developers can inspect, improve, and adapt the tool they rely on.

## Documentation

- **[Docs](https://openpocketcine.app/docs/)** — protocol, iOS and Android apps, and how to
  build. Preview locally with `just handbook`. Keep them current in the same PR
  ([standard](https://openpocketcine.app/docs/contribute/documentation/)).

- [`docs/PARITY.md`](docs/PARITY.md) — operator-visible iOS / Android contract
- [`docs/PERFORMANCE.md`](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) — live-path SLOs (frame rate, ACK, HUD)
- [`docs/UX.md`](docs/UX.md) — FTUE, operator copy, help, failure states
- [`docs/RELEASE.md`](docs/RELEASE.md) — `main` + PRs + `v*` tags (no Git Flow)

## Architecture

Production targets a shared Swift business/protocol core with native platform shells:

| Layer | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Shared core** | `Sources/OpenPocketViewCore/` | DUML framing, datalink, BLE adverts, commands, status |
| **iOS app** | `ios/OpenPocketCine/` | SwiftUI shell, CoreBluetooth, Hotspot Configuration, VideoToolbox |
| **Android app** | `Apps/Android/app/` | Jetpack Compose phone shell and Android platform adapters |
| **Android facade** | `Sources/OpenPocketCineAndroidFacade/` | Swift session and JNI boundary for Android |
| **Tests** | `Tests/OpenPocketViewCoreTests/` | Swift package tests — framing, transport, discovery, layout |

The shared Swift core owns protocol logic and stays portable (no SwiftUI, UIKit, or Android
dependencies). Platform shells own sockets, permissions, lifecycle, rendering, and UI.

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Built in the open

OpenPocketCine is deliberately, transparently built in public with the latest frontier models
such as Grok, Codex, and Claude. Engineering guidelines live in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

OpenPocketCine went through an extended private R&D phase before publication; the public
repository starts from a clean slate with a squashed initial commit rather than carrying the
experimental history along.

## Credits

### Osmosis

I learned the BLE pairing and camera Wi-Fi connection path with the help of
[Osmosis](https://github.com/KonradIT/osmosis) by Konrad Iturbe — a generous open Android client
for Osmo cameras. I'm grateful. OpenPocketCine is its own implementation; Osmosis was inspiration
for that connection story, not a source I copied.

Please go look at [Osmosis](https://github.com/KonradIT/osmosis) too. If you care about talking to
Osmo cameras, Konrad's work is worth your time.

## No vendor SDK

This project is not affiliated with DJI. No DJI SDK or proprietary documentation is included in,
distributed with, or required by this project.

## Development

Tooling is managed through [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just):

```bash
just setup         # install meta-check tools (macOS / Homebrew)
just               # list all recipes
just handbook      # docs at http://127.0.0.1:4321/ (live: https://openpocketcine.app/docs/)
just check         # run repository quality checks
just format        # format Swift sources
just test          # run Swift package tests
just native-check  # run Swift tests and build the native iOS app
just android-build # build the Android app and staged Swift runtime
just android-check # build, test, and lint Android
just android-play-setup # one-time Play Console + signing (closed testing)
```

The iOS Xcode project is generated:

```bash
cd ios && xcodegen generate && open OpenPocketCine.xcodeproj
```

The Simulator has no Bluetooth or camera Wi-Fi. Pairing and live view need a physical iPhone or
Android phone.

iOS beta: [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/1tmt3aEB). Archives come from Xcode Cloud. One-time App Store Connect setup:

```bash
./scripts/setup-xcode-cloud.sh
```

See [`docs/testflight-ci.md`](docs/testflight-ci.md).

Android closed testing: signed AAB from GitHub Actions onto Play closed testing
(`alpha`), the same shape as OpenZCine’s Play Internal pipeline. One-time
Play Console / signing:

```bash
just android-play-setup          # walkthrough (Console, keystore, API robot)
just android-play-sync-secrets   # push play-closed GitHub secrets
```

See [`docs/android-play-ci.md`](docs/android-play-ci.md).
