# OpenPocketCine

Open-source iOS + Android app to connect to and monitor **DJI Osmo Nano** with AVC live view.
Only Nano is a supported camera profile.

## Stack & paths

- **Swift Package Manager / Swift** — portable protocol core (`Sources/OpenPocketViewCore/`).
- **SwiftUI** — iOS/iPadOS shell (`ios/OpenPocketCine/`, XcodeGen).
- **Jetpack Compose / Kotlin** — Android shell (`Apps/Android/`).
- **Go** — independent, video-only LAN viewer (`Apps/NanoMonitor/`).
- **just** — every repo task. Run `just` to list recipes. `just setup` on macOS.

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `Sources/OpenPocketViewCore/` | Portable Swift core |
| `Tests/OpenPocketViewCoreTests/` | Core tests |
| `ios/OpenPocketCine/` | SwiftUI shell |
| `Apps/Android/` | Compose shell and adapters |
| `Apps/NanoMonitor/` | Standalone Go module with an FFplay display adapter |
| `Sources/OpenPocketCineAndroidFacade/` | Android JNI facade |
| `docs/` | Engineering references |
| `handbook/src/content/docs/` | Public docs site (apps, protocol, setup) |
| `site/` | GitHub Pages landing |
| `.github/` | CI and templates |

`captures/` is gitignored.

## Hard rules

- Keep the Swift core **portable**: Foundation-only protocol and business logic.
- Live view is **enable-once**: `0x09/0xa8` starts the stream and is the only PLI. After picture, further enables follow the **watchdog** only.
- **Hygiene:** secrets, camera Wi-Fi passwords, PII, unofficial LUT dumps, and `captures/`, `Osmo LUTS/`, `vendor/`, `ref/`, `.local/` stay out of git. Official Rec.709 cubes under `ios/OpenPocketCine/Resources/` and `Apps/Android/app/src/main/assets/luts/` are tracked.
- Work on a branch (`feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, …) and open a PR into `main`. Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `build:`, `test:`). Tags and version trains: [`docs/RELEASE.md`](docs/RELEASE.md).
- `AGENTS.md` is canonical for every agent. Client stubs (`CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX.md`, `GROK.md`) are pointers only — do not copy these rules into a second instruction file. Do not add Cursor, Copilot, Gemini, or Windsurf instruction dumps.

## Before you edit

1. Name the surface: core, iOS **shell**, Android **shell**, or docs.
2. Load every pointer whose trigger matches.
3. If the change is operator-visible, read **parity** and touch both shells or record the exception in `docs/PARITY.md`.

## Verification

- `just check` — full repository quality gate.
- `just native-check` — Swift lint/test plus iOS simulator build and tests.
- `just android-check` — Gradle assembleDebug, unit tests, lint.
- `just nano-monitor-check` — Go formatting, vet, race tests and binary build.
- **physical:** operator-visible work is proven on a real iPhone or Android device for the platform changed. Simulator has no BLE or camera Wi-Fi. Compile-only is not done.

## Completion

A task is not done until `just check` is green for the paths touched, docs that describe the behavior are updated, **parity** is held or an exception is recorded in `docs/PARITY.md`, no forbidden paths are staged, and operator-visible work is **physical** for the platform changed. A live-path change also still meets **budget**. Protocol, app, or setup that visitors read is updated in the **handbook** (`handbook/src/content/docs/`) in the same PR — [Keeping docs current](handbook/src/content/docs/contribute/documentation.md).

## Sediment

`STATUS.md`, `OVERNIGHT.md`, and `.planning/` are local or dated notes. They are not current architecture. `docs/connection-reliability-plan.md` is a dated PR plan, not a contract. Live reliability is [`docs/connection-reliability.md`](docs/connection-reliability.md).
